Modeling of detection with Cas13 and Csm6
A kinetic scheme of chemical reactions was created and populated with known kinetic rates and equilibrium constants. Kinetic rates were used where they were known, where only equilibrium rates were known, the forward rates were assumed to be 1 nM^-1*sec^-1 and a reverse rate was chosen to produce the known equilibrium constant. Rates and equilibrium constants were simmilar to those derived in previous publications.(insert citations here Cas13 citations: 1. A. East-Seletsky, M. R. O’Connell, S. C. Knight, D. Burstein, J. H.

Add some csm6 citations as well) For the carf domain a Km was known instead of a Kd, so the carf kcat was subtracted from the reverse rate to produce an approximate Kd. The cas13 background cleavage rate was selected to match the background rate observed in cas13 preparations. The full kinetic scheme can be found in supplement (insert supplement number here). This kinetic scheme was then converted into a system of ordinary differential equations modeling the rate of change in the concentration of each reaction component as a function of time and the concentrations of the components using Mathematica. A numerical solution to the system of ordinary differential equations was created with a time step of 0.001 seconds and a total time of 2000 seconds using the Mathematica's NDSolve at different concentrations of viral target and at different values for the carf kcat. The full system of ordinary differential equations and starting conditions can be found in supplement (insert supplement number here).
